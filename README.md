# 🏗️ Well-Architected Microservices Application & CI/CD Pipeline with AWS  

![AWS Microservices CI/CD](https://your-image-link.com)  

## 📖 Project Overview  

This project demonstrates how to build a **Well-Architected microservices application** and implement a **CI/CD pipeline** using AWS services. The goal is to create **scalable, secure, and cost-optimized** cloud-native applications while following AWS **best practices**.  

🚀 **Key Objectives:**  
✅ Deploy a **Node.js web application** running on AWS RDS.  
✅ Use **AWS Cloud9** as the development environment.  
✅ Convert a **monolithic application** into **containerized microservices**.  
✅ Store container images in **Amazon ECR** and deploy with **ECS (Fargate)**.  
✅ Set up a **Blue/Green Deployment** model with **AWS CodePipeline**.  
✅ Configure **Application Load Balancer (ALB)** for autoscaling.  
✅ Enable continuous integration & deployment with **AWS CodeBuild, CodeDeploy, and CodePipeline**.  
✅ Optimize for **AWS Well-Architected Framework** (Security, Reliability, Cost, Performance, Sustainability).

## ⚙️ **Tech Stack & AWS Services Used**  

### **1️⃣ Development & Source Control**  
- **AWS Cloud9** → Cloud-based IDE for efficient development.  
- **AWS CodeCommit** → Secure Git-based repository.  

### **2️⃣ Containerization & Orchestration**  
- **Docker** → Containerized microservices for modular architecture.  
- **Amazon ECR** → Stores & version-controls container images.  
- **Amazon ECS (Fargate)** → Serverless container orchestration.  

### **3️⃣ Deployment & Traffic Management**  
- **Application Load Balancer (ALB)** → Distributes traffic efficiently.  
- **AWS CodePipeline** → Automates CI/CD for deployments.  
- **AWS CodeDeploy** → Enables seamless Blue/Green Deployments.  

### **4️⃣ Database & Storage**  
- **Amazon RDS (PostgreSQL)** → Managed relational database.  
- **Amazon S3** → Stores logs, backups, and deployment artifacts.  

### **5️⃣ Monitoring & Security**  
- **Amazon CloudWatch** → Logs & metrics for observability.  
- **AWS IAM** → Secure access management for AWS resources.

## 🏗️ **AWS Well-Architected Framework**  

This project aligns with the **six AWS Well-Architected Pillars** to ensure a secure, scalable, and cost-effective cloud environment:  

🔹 **Operational Excellence** → Automated deployments, monitoring, and logging.  
🔹 **Security** → IAM role-based access, encrypted storage, and secure pipelines.  
🔹 **Reliability** → Blue/Green Deployment ensures seamless updates with rollback capabilities.  
🔹 **Performance Efficiency** → Auto-scaling and serverless containers.  
🔹 **Cost Optimization** → Fargate eliminates server costs, and CodePipeline automates workflows.  
🔹 **Sustainability** → Optimized resource usage and serverless deployments.

## 🔀 **Why Blue/Green Deployment for Microservices?**  

📌 **What is Blue/Green Deployment?**  
Blue/Green Deployment runs **two identical environments** (Blue = current, Green = new) to switch traffic seamlessly after testing, reducing downtime and risk.  

📌 **Benefits for Microservices:**  
✅ **Zero Downtime** → Ensures continuous service availability.  
✅ **Easy Rollback** → Instantly revert to the previous stable version if issues arise.  
✅ **Scalability & Resilience** → Each microservice updates independently.  
✅ **Improved Testing** → Run A/B testing and performance checks before going live.

## 💰 **Project Cost Estimate**  

AWS Service | Estimated Monthly Cost 💵  
------------ | --------------------  
ECS Fargate | ~$30  
RDS PostgreSQL | ~$25  
S3 Storage | ~$5  
CloudWatch Logs | ~$10  
ALB & Networking | ~$15  
CodePipeline, CodeBuild, CodeDeploy | ~$10  
**Total Estimate:** | **~$95/month**  

🔹 **Optimizations:** Use **auto-scaling, Spot Instances, and S3 lifecycle policies** to reduce costs.
